Rather than criticize other peoples stories here some of my own try:

# Listening to the univers

## Intro

It was always clear after some time it came down to a scentence like:
"You are not adapted". And he always knew they where right at least from their perspective.
And that he thought was the real cause of the problem, has there always be only
one view on the thinks? 

Or are always these people right that had a perfectly well understanding cast
down from history of people like Newton and Einstein and so one.
Without realizing they woud not have acceppted their thinking in their time.
Not talking about he thinking to keep up with people like this, but only to make a point in which direction things where going.

So it was always clear that he cound not keep a job for a long time, 
the othere way around a job cound not keep hist attention for a long time.
And that was not a problem as a software developer there were always new 
challenges and the whole sector was not so much fixed on a long term commitment.

At last he thought he found the right place to be, he started with much enthusiasm
this place offered so much possbilities in direction that caught his attention.
It was a reasonable new software enviroment, it was a development recognizable
and it had something to do with astronomy his favorite theme as he was young.
He worked for a privatly founded project to search extra terestical life.

And the theme was really fascinating to boil down tons of data to some useful 
bits an pieces that coud hold a prove on the existence of life out there.
With time a conviction came to his mind the haystack was far to big and the 
method for searching was like using a magnet to find a needle. 
Which is a perfectt, if you really know the thing your are searching for 
is a needle that is magnetic.

And so the end for this came earlier or later, and it came with not much of surprise
if you were able to read the signs along the way.

## Change

At that stage it was obvious that some change was required, and so he took a job that had noting to do with software. It was not too difficult to get a job like roast burgers or sort packages to shelves in the supermarket. But he also took care of the fact that the jobs left some spare time where he coud do what he thought was right. 

In first step he collected some radio data from the public calculation project. What he did was not perfecly backed by law, but as always it was a give and take. He calculated data units on his computer for his former institution, but also stored the data unit for his own processing.

With time he tried diffrent approaches and it proved more difficult as it looked, was no wonder as many people had before tried to find a way to interpret the data. And he came close to thinking that maybe life did choose many diffrent approaches that assuming that all lifeforms will reveal themselve by electromagnectic emissions might be wrong.

But with time came the realization that not searching the haystack with many diffrent ideas what the needle might look like was the right approach, but sorting the stems. Which was as a idea is as simple as filling a glas of water. But with a haystack as big as the univers seemed like a delusions of grandeur.

## Work

Step by step he was collecting data about regions of the sky and his real ally were projects like the "Sloan Digital Sky Survey" which published their data freely. And with combining the data sets from diffrent sources and overlay the different spectral ranges. There was a picture that as comming closer.
Not the picture that he wanted, but in the end he coud with the help of other intrested people build a software that recognized natural sources of electormagnetic emmission and classify them.

The term other intrested people seems so simple but there was the real work behind this, there were not only astronomers, but also chemist and physicist. To find answers to diffferent phenomens on the sky. 
And with sorting away the things that were known there came up some new discoveries. And as always it was hard to convince people with a professional background to reveal some bits of information but there were some enthusiasts that filled in valuable input and also got some new ideas while discusing.

## Discovery

With a approach of sorting the emissions in the sky to diffrent natural phemnoms, partly by software and others with human help, both in a recursive loop with successive improvements. There was a noise in the end that coud not be explained natuaraly but looked totally random. 

Many way to solve this dileme didn't bring any improvement, but it was obvious that transmission was made by some stars but not by others. Some of the stars with this strange singal had previously been discovered as suns with planets.

## Decoding

From there it still took the some month of work, with many people that willing to cooperate on the subject. 
But what was first seen as noise revealed over time some fixed frames of freqency distributions, that repeatead with a given interval. That made it obvious that there was some meaning behind the signals. 

And step by step the discoveries came, there were different channels of data transmissions.
And with adavance of technical abilities of the sending civilisations the use of one or fixed frequency bands was abandoned, and using the whole spectrum for transmission was favored. And with this the symbols were not transmitted sequential but syncronous with a frequenncy distribution. This method allow distributing the signal with reasonable power over long distances.

What made it unterstandable what the meaning of diffrent symbols was, were picture frames embedded as a explanation of the symbols repeated over time. The pictures where just two dimensional, but delivered some basics about what the meaning of a symbol was and how they related to each other. With that discovery it was obvious that this was more linked to the chinese way of writing than the western approach. And with the pictures there were diffrent methods of coding to recogize like reading the lines diagonal. And also it was also obvious that some species that were used to dwell in gas or liquid did not such a great job to simplify their pictures to a two dimensional representation for transmission.  

Repeatedly embedded into the datastream where some basic about the universe like spectral lines of hydrogen, some mathematic basics (event if many differnt number system needed to be adapted).

## Adapting

What came most surpring was the number of data streams that was discovered almost one of thousends suns in the galaxy did distribute such a signal. But what was also obvious that many of the distributed informations were not teschnical, but just simple bits and pieces how life was going in diffrent places.
And there were places that were beyond conservative thinking about how life was formed and how it evolved.
Only very few organisms are dwelling on a solid surface, some are floating in the athmosphere of a gas giant others are below the surface of a boiling hot crust.

As the discoveries did spread to many people there was a real hype that technolgy woud make a great leap with all this information. But disappointment was swift, as most enviroments were so different that transfering their discoveries was such a big projet that developing a suited solution on it's own coud have be done with the same effort. 
Like copy a schema from a sea dwelling race to dive the ocean, but realzing that they had no need to adaped to such a big difference in pressure and for various other things.

And also it was obvious that most of othere civilisations hat similar stage as ours, there was some data that that coud not be processed it contained concepts that were beyond our present unterstanding. Not that nobody made a try to explain the concepts but there was not much of common ground. Like newtons dicoveries made only sense in a enviroment where it was aggread on a concept what was a physical unit is. Or not so nicely said: With sending a plan for a mobile device just a few years back woud not earn much applause.

## Misconception

After some time the insight struck most people, discoveries were not made by just one bright mind, but it also needed a enviroment where these thoughts were almost obvious, and various small steps that prepeared soemthing what in the end looked like a great leap.

But if you were standing in he beginning with just a faint idea where the journey coud end the track looked unfeasible. 

And what was most astonishing for some main expectations like traveling with the speed of light there was no solution, even for the problem of transfering data faster that light there was no apperent solution. And that was some part of the problem you coud just listen but not asking back. And most of the informations received was of civilazations that might not event exist as we read their informations. But they decided to distribute their content so it might be of some help to others.

## Sharing

So the final decision was obvious, against all concerns earth did join the stream and distribute it's discoveries on the galactic data stream.

# Why things do fail

### It's the fault of the industrie

If feel that aggemnt sticks, i must say sorry this is not a discustion for you.
I know as a modern person its common sense to to blame the industrie.
But if you think thats reasonable you simply accept the role as a customer. 
Whats wrong about that? Nobody forced you into that role so you shoud be free to change it.
Not totally but for some small parts, this shoud be possible.

So if you work with a program, and dont like it, and you are a programmer write a better one.

### Why do we talk about things

Well, just to be start from common ground.
If you think there are no things that fail but our understanding of them you are 
perfecly got the point (no further reading required).

Why is it acceptable to change the subject in that way?
For one small part, it comes from my own background i grew up in crafstsman family
that means you confronted from the first moment with the facts: the material is right, 
the cirumtances are right, the customers are right.
If something goes wrong you wrecked it.

### Why is it acceptable to talk about us?

I think the train of thought comes from a sublime understand of our civilisation.
It shoud us protected from all sorts of downfalls.
And is is right civilisation is all about to evolve our livinig above the donwfalls of nature.
Just one example: 
As people lived in caves it was essentail to discover the secrets of making fire to create a source of 
warmth that was not depended of lighting an othere seldom phenomenons.

And as we live our civilisation takes us step by step ahead of being depended on nature.
But still we need to be realistic what out present stage allows us to think about as safe, and whats not.
Right about the fire, sure we can manage that with central heating and so on.
But stills its intrestig to try this in a different setting say in a forest when its raining, huh not so easy.

### Why do we make mistakes?

But this point is not the whole point, if we always thtink of everthing as normal.
Nobody whoud habe left the caves our predecessor lived in for millennia.

And for sure the first on who tried to live outside was laught upon by the ones that stayed back.
Are there no real mistakes? For shure not, but who always knows ahead of time whats wrong or right
may not always be right (but may be prefecly accustomed to his own culture).
