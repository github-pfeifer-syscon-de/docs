* siren mentality
* if you cannot convince someone, shout at him that will definitely proof, you are right!
* if this is not working try to shout louder
* if this is not working order a professional intimidating service, with the privatizing in most official areas you can buy anything for money
* if this is not working try to get more people who support your point, and don't be limit by the bounds of logic or reason
* and you may finally realize, that reason and logic are the things you need to convince someone. Sorry my fault, if you got this far you will never realize this ....
* As this has been on the news for such a long time it qualifies by its subtle irony "Ich musste als Ermittler Ã¼ber 1.000 Onanie-Videos schauen", as you decided to spy on people this shoud not come as a surpriste to you. I never heard of car-mechanic complaining about oil and grease.
* on viewing "the awakening of the force" i was amazed how much it is based on vengeance (beside all the other pop-culture references). What can we expect for the next sequels 15. we destory a galaxy 27. the univers 54. some multiverses (until the then they shoud have come up with something bigger to destroy)

Do you believe people that just push one point and not taking any simple matter of fact into account? And anyway if one point is everywhere it is most certainly made up.
