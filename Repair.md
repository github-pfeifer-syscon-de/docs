# Repair

## G500

A nice mouse from logitech. But as commented in various places, the switches wear out.
(The suggested solution to complete replace the switches seems a bit harsh.) 
I follwed some instruction to open the mouse (careful if you split the two halves open there is a thin connetion between that might tear, so just gently divide it up and after the first crack don't use any force). Inside i found lots of lint on the scroll wheel, removing these might be worth to get the orginal feel back (i'am not shure if liked the stiff motion better...).
But back to the switches i used some adhesive tape to bridge the possible gap between the plastic and the switch (i used some old tape as it needs to stick in place, but not to hold the switch down if you press it...).
And at at last putting everything back again, it worked like new.

### final

The effect is nice but wears out after some weeks... :(

So the final solution is more or less, to replace the switches. This is difficult as the mouse is build from two pcb's that are stacked and the solder pads for the switches are barly accessible from each sides. But after some hard cuts to crack the switches, allow to remove the pins one by one (beware there is no turning back) it worked (the gm8 switches are sligtly snappier that the default ones (or the old ones just wore out over time ...)) (nothing i would suggest to someone that is just building some expirience in soldering).
