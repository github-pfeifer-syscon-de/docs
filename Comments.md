### Caprica

Q&A about series with a a dramtic finale nicely constructed, and battlestar is the logic sequel

Q: Where do the people from caprica come form?

A: As they have the same gods than the ancient romans(/greek), so they may have migrated from there (mean here back then).

Q: Ah, where did the last imperator of the roman empire on earth did go?

A: He must have fled from earth, with hyper speed space ship.

Q: Why did he not leave back some nice piece of his technology?

A: Mankind didn't deserve this, as they did choose monotheism (mostly).

Q: Did it work to flee from this new concept? 

A: No, somehow the idea was transfered over lightyears to caprica.

Q: What caused its society downfall

A: A god complex (of many characters), know who suffered from that before?

What makes the story true, is that it has the courage not simply saying this person or group is responsible, but to show that many individuals or groups not acting right on track (or better badly or not interacting at all) lead to such a catastrophic result.

### Battlestar Galactica

It shows off almost every human weakness or pitfal so the final words come as a inevitable consequence.

It is like 2001 (in reverse gear).

### Voyager

Did non of the program directors has a heart, right away when Cpt. Janeway comes home she has to start her odysee again. At least one week of recreation woud be fair.


Nice as it shows even with super technologie the distaces within the milkyway are still vast.


But wait, traveling half the way thru the milkyway are 70000 light years with the first estimates are 75 years of travel, this woud result in a traveling distance of 1000 lightyears a year. Which is 1000 times the speed of light (they call it warp 9.975 without counting any interesting sightseeing)... 

Now the settings in a few hundret years in the future seems not too plausible, the people thousend years back had at least invented the wheel and learned how to handle fire and had a writing.

Kepler had discovered the rules of planetary motion in the 17th century. 400 hundred years later the first piece of human work leaves our solar system. In 2015 it was 122AE or 16 light hours away. The distance of the next star is 4.25 light years.

Better stick to the things we know (at the moment):

### Space 1999

This is a nice series as it much more relies on the fact the humans are thrown into space, and not so much emporers as Cpt. Kirk just to name a example (i know he calls himself a explorer but... Cpt. Archer does a better job on that).

The first season at least tries to state some physical discoveries of the time, but if they talk about traveling between galaxies it undos all the previous effort.

It implements the TV series paradigm of the 80's: if a unknown crew member appears in the first minutes, he or she will most certainly die. 

But also it displays for some part a overestimate on human possiblities in a postive and negative way:

positive : We did not throw the moon out of earth orbit with a nuclear explosion

negative : We dont have a permanent settlement on surface of the moon

Well for that part i'm happy that future is not always as bad as some people think, even if it is also not so much advanced.

But for one funny fact i think they were right, at the time of the 80's it was bold to expect a computer to assist in serious decicions (at the time some nerds had a home computer and programmed it in basic and a few buisness computers where around with 64KByte (see [IBM AT](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer)) memory and floppy disk storage). 

Nowadays i think only few people will book a flight without asking a search engine to find the best price or time or even navigate to a new location without trusting a navigation device with some algorithm to find the fastest or shortest way.

### "Leviathan Wakes" to "Abaddon's Gate"

A very nicely designed universe with many thoughts on physical effects with detective Miller, Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante.

### The hydrogen sonata

I only say "Washing chip instructions included" is this right?, "Mistake Not" and Vyr Cossont .

### Arthur

Well why did Til Schweiger appear there? Shoud they not have asked ABBA?

### The Hunger Games


One idea giver might have been Jean d'arc from medival times.

### Babylon 5

It is the story of:
* north-america's independence war (the first leave the galaxy)
* second word war (war against president clark)
* america's civil war against slavery (support for telepats)

retold.

At least they have some space in their space opera.

### 2001

[2001 : A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29)

### Star wars

#### Episode IV (A new hope)

If you are going to like this in the future don't read further, remember Sheldon, Amy and Indiana Jones!

This whole epic advanture coud end in it's first minutes if not someone was saying "A unmanned escape capsule, don't shoot." 

Well if this is true these implications follow:
* This empire is so unbelievable evil that it kills people without even thinking, but saves robots
* If always the dark lord must be asked to follow a simple lead the empire will most certainly die on bureaucracy
* From that you can see they have a second more or less hidden power, guess what it is 

I like the order of the jedi much more, they order a whole army and forget about it, this i think is the real opposite of bureaucracy. But wait if they miss something of that scale ... well who says that nice people tend to [overorganize](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/overorganize) their lives ;)

After entering the rebel ship dark vader's orders "take this ship appart to find the plans (of the death star)". One minute later a office reports "They are not on this ship". Well either the plans are really big so they can be found in the loading bay with just one glimpse, or he has done a lousy job on searching.

The galaxy far away has never learned the basics about securing their systems against hackers (R2D2 in this case).

#### Episode V (The empire strikes back)

Note to myself: 

a) Secure a patent for self warming underwear, when compact atomic heating becomes available

b) plan a trading post on hoth (strange name shoud it not be coldh ?)

#### Episode VI (The return of the jedi)

Some costumes are really old.

#### Finsish

A bad thing about this if you start once thinking like this you can't stop going on like this...

### Otherland

A word that might not be to far, but far to frightening.

### Interstellar

Beware "spoiler":

Well i'm not quite sure i really understand the implications

of the created termporal paradox, of a person that decides

not to go on the journey, and tries to get back to himself with the message "stay". 

But the the next moment sends the coordinates of the undergound NASA to himself...

I dont want to be mean, but it is confusing that for one part there are 
very detailed and realistic effects (of physics as we know it today) 
and for some other parts not at all.

But anyway very nice pictures, nice drama.

### Crunchyroll

If you like anime here you go....

For most medias you know beforhand what you can expect, e.g. movies for example in the action category/genre will clearly be recognizable as such.... 

With anime it is a bit diffrent they put you in a rollercoster and visit mostly all of the available categories or genres. 

There seem to be common pattern for characters, put together a pragmatic person and a enthusiastic one, that should provide always some fun ...

#### Mrs. Kobayashis dragon maid

If you expect just to get some fun story and (....) wait for episode 13 all at once it will be serious ...

Some view into everyday life in Japan i guess...

#### Lycoris recoil

The reference to "die hard" is true in more than one sense...

If you don't mind a zynic view of the world, and some brutal scenes, that come in a nice package go ahead.

And after all i'am not convinced that this advocates that force will solve any problem (like said in the first episode "create a illusion of peace").
